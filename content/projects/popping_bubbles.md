## Msc Thesis Project: The sonic signature of ancient air bubbles in ice cores
**Keywords:** *ice cores; paleoclimate; Greenland; polar research; Continuous Flow Analysis;
sound measurements; total air content; Python; spectral analysis; bubbles*

The air bubbles occluded in polar ice cores contain extremely valuable paleoclimatic
information in the form of ancient air, whose composition can be determined in the lab
yielding time series of gas concentrations in atmosphere spanning millennia.
Another characteristic of the ancient air bubbles is their popping sound emission
when ice core samples are being controllably melted for high-resolution Continuous Flow
Analysis measurements.

We would like to investigate the audio signal of the "popping" bubbles. Our goal
is to perform high quality sound recordings followed by spectral analysis of the
bubble popping frequencies in order to infer how many and how large the bubbles are.
Therefore, we offer a Master thesis project for a motivated student who will further develop
the recording and melting system as well as work on the data analysis of the sounds recordings.

You can expect to gain skills in sound and bubble physics, sound recordings as well
as high resolution ice core measurements. You will also work with noise filtering and
spectral analysis techniques. Prior experience in data analysis with Python/Matlab is a plus.
[PICE](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/research/pice/) is an active, multinational/multicultural group
with plenty of learning opportunities.

### We will be happy to hear from you!
