## Msc Thesis Project: The sonic signature of ancient air bubbles in ice cores
Are you looking for an exciting Msc thesis project where you can combine your **Python** computational skills with inverse methods and state of the art datasets of **N<sub>2</sub> and Ar isotopes** in order to look far back in **Greenland's past climate**? If you are fascinated by **polar research** and curious about **climate change processes** this may be a unique chance for you to join a dynamic group with decades of history in polar and ice core research.

You will be looking into the abrupt warming signals during the sudden end of the last Ice Age about 12,000 ago and using a state-of-the-art model of [snow densification and gas diffusion](https://github.com/UWGlaciology/CommunityFirnModel) you will work towards quantifying the magnitude and rapidity of the abrupt climate change during this time. We require that you are familiar with Python and you can expect your skills to get very sharp during the duration of the project. You will get hands-on experience with polar snow/firn modelling tools and high quality datasets of N<sub>2</sub> and Ar isotopes from the air bubbles in the ancient ice.
We are a very open and dynamic [group](https://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/research/pice/) with a variety of nationalities and backgrounds as well as a wide international network of collaborations.
Should you have any questions on the project feel free to contact:
