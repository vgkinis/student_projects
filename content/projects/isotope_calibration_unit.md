## Msc Thesis Project: Developping a micro-flow calibration unit for high precision water isotope analysis in ice cores

**Keywords:** *ice cores; paleoclimate; Greenland; polar research; laser spectroscopy; water isotopes; Python; Continuous Flow Analysis; CAD design; micro-fluidics*

At the Water Isotope Laboratory at [PICE](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/research/pice/), we are looking for
a motivated student to work on a new and exciting project on ice core instrumentation development.
We are interested to investigate the use of microfluidics and in particular
piezo-actuated micropumps for high-resolution ice core analysis.
Our goal is to develop a very low-flow, stable and automated module for the calibration
of laser spectroscopy measurements of the stable isotopes of water in ice cores as well as
in atmospheric vapor at very low humidity environments (such as the polar ice core
drilling sites in Greenland and Antarctica). The project can also be extended to
and have useful impact on high-resolution continuous-flow analysis techniques
for ice cores.  

You will become part of an active and social group and can expect to sharpen your skills in Python
and Arduino programming as well as CAD design and instrument control.
We expect some prior experience with Python and optimally micro-controllers/Arduino language.
You can also expect to get hands-on training on laboratory techniques and laser spectroscopy
focused on high precision ice core measurements.

### We are looking forward to hearing from you!
